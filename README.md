# CSCI 202: M03.2-Hash Functions
- Professor Name: Dr. Carver
- Course: CSCI 202: Data Structures and Algorithms
- Due date: 11.09.2024

## Assignment Instructions
- Write definition of search, isItemAtEqual, retrieve, remove, print, constructor, and destructor for class hashT based upon a method of your choice from the PowerPoint or otherwise. Write a test program to test with at least 3 different hashing functions.    

## My Methods
- This program uses hash functions. It asks the user to enter the element to be stored and the corresponding key. Currently, the program only allows users to enter integer values. I have utilized hash functions in my database class to hash users' passwords, providing an extra layer of security against potential hackers. Additionally, the program prompts the user to choose from the following options: add an element, search for an element, remove an element, and exit the program. The only way to exit is by pressing 4, corresponding to the exit option.
